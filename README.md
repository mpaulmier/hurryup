HurryUp is a small browser extension for displaying the actual duration of a video, taking into account the playback rate set by the user.

This extension is compatible with [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock "SponsorBlock") which means that the calculated time will take into account the truncated sponsored part.

## Roadmap

These are the things I'd like to add to this extension in no particular order:

* [x] Add compatibility with [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock "SponsorBlock") so that the time without sponsors is taken into account
* [ ] Add an option to display the calculated time on the thumbnail
  * [ ] Add a configuration for selected a prefered playback rate for thumbnails
* [ ] Add calculated current time in the video

If you think of a feature that would fit this project, don't hesitate to open an issue on github and I'll review it.
